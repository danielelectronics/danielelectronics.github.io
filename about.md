About This Site
==========
I previously had a Wordpress.com site that I started in my senior year of college (the first time around). I made the site because I wanted to have something cool come up when potential employers googled my name. The posts on this website from 2016 were originally on that website. After I got my first job I didn't touch my website for about four years, but knew I wanted to do more with it. I wanted to redo the website on my own, writing the HTML, CSS, and Javascript myself, but I also wanted to keep the barrier to writing new posts as low as possible. I ended up using the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but instead of using a theme I decided I would write my own layouts and styling. This site is the result. You can see the source code on Github, but I am not a web developer so my code (especially the CSS) is not pretty, and I relied heavily on sites like W3Schools and Codepen for examples.
